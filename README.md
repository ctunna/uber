Source code for GP algorithm is in src/uber/core.clj

Source code for simulation environments is in models/
These can only be run from core.clj in a headless environment.

The benchmark demo is included in the directory above this and it can
be ran by humans.     ../demo.nlogo

I had problems packaging all of this up into a jar. Netlogo would have
had to of been included and it wasn't as straight forward as I had
anticipated. If you want to run the program I can set it up on a
server that you can SSH into. However, nothing more than what is shown in
the final report is output.
